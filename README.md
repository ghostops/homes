# Homes

This is my first ever attempt at building something in GoLang!

A simple CRUD-app with a React frontend and GoLang backend.

The project is to showcase places that you've lived at on a map with pictures and the dates.

## Run the project

Visit the individual READMEs in the Backend and Frontend folders for details :)
